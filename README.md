# shopping-list-to-do
This is a simple shopping list "todo" app.  
  
  Features:  
  * Click listener on the Unordered List (UL) tag that performs a "text strikethrough" on any child list item (LI) that was clicked.  
  * Delete buttons created via DOM Manipulation for each list item (LI) tag that delete the targeted list item (LI) when clicked.  
  * When entering data into the text field, the key code is targeted for the "enter" key so if you hit it, it will submit it to the list instead of clicking on the button.
